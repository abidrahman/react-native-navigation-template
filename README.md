# Navigation Template Project
## for react-native developments

This code is provided as a template project for developers wishing to create a react-native project that uses basic navigation between screens, using the generic [Navigator component](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html).

Provided is a basic routing setup with an initial route and two additional screens that demonstrate the push and pop methods of the Navigator component for the purpose of transitioning between screens.

Additionally, an example of how to pass values between screens using properties.

## Android Instructions

Setup the react-native environment for Android development as described in the [guides](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html).

Navigate to the directory into which you have cloned this project and execute the following command:

```
$ npm install
```

This will install the dependencies required by the project. Once completed - assuming you have an Android emulator/device setup and ready - you can then execute the following command to build, deploy, and run the code as an app on your device/emulator:

```
$ react-native run-android
```

Have fun!
